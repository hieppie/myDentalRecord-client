# My Dental Record: Logging and referencing your personal dental records

As a former registered dental hygienist, I know how important it is to have a record of all of your past dental treatment. This free application will help users, or in this case patients, create an account and log of of their dental treatment for future references. This application will help users as references when they want to:

- Dispute a treatment or payment of a treatment with their dental provider.
- Settle a treatment or the payment of the treatment with their insurance.
- Have a collective record for all of their dental treatments from different dental providers.
